# Challenge 2 - VBA Script

This Visual Basic for Applications script will cycle through stock data in an Excel spreadsheet and summarise the data for the year. It can cycle through multiple sheets in a workbook.

* Each stock is summarised with the opening to closing change for the year, the percentage of that change and the total volume over the year.
* The change for the year and percentage is colour-coded green for increase or red for decrease.
* There is an extra summary for greatest increase, decrease and volume.

There are three screen captures in this folder showing the top part of each of the final outputs.
